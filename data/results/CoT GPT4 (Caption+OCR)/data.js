    "response": "The work done by the spring is equal to the kinetic energy of the canister before it hits the spring. The work done by the spring is given by the formula W = 1/2 * k * d^2, where k is the spring constant and d is the distance the spring is compressed. The kinetic energy of the canister is given by the formula KE = 1/2 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the canister and v is its velocity. Setting these two equal to each other gives:\n\n1/2 * k * d^2 = 1/2 * m * v^2\n\nSolving for d gives:\n\nd = sqrt((m * v^2) / k)\n\nSubstituting the given values gives:\n\nd = sqrt((0.40 kg * (0.50 m/s)^2) / 750 N/m)\n\nd = sqrt((0.40 kg * 0.25 m^2/s^2) / 750 N/m)\n\nd = sqrt(0.10 kg*m^2/s^2 / 750 N/m)\n\nd = sqrt(0.0001333 m^2)\n\nd = 0.0115 m\n\nSo, the spring is compressed by a distance of approximately 0.012 m or 1.2 cm."

The solution involves recognizing that the infinite ladder of resistors is a self-similar system, meaning that the resistance between points a and b is the same as the resistance of one resistor plus the resistance of the entire ladder. \n\nLet's denote the resistance between points a and b as X. According to the problem, each resistor has a resistance of 1 ohm (R=1). \n\nWe can write the following equation based on the properties of resistors in series and parallel:\n\nX = R + (R*X) / (R + X)\n\nSubstituting R=1, we get:\n\nX = 1 + X / (1 + X)\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for X, we get X = 1 + sqrt(2), which is approximately 2.41 ohms.\n\nSo, the resistance between terminals a and b is 2.41 ohms."

    "response": "Given that $ST=8, TR=4$, and $PT=6$, we can use the Triangle Proportionality Theorem to find $QR$.\n\nThe theorem states that if a line is parallel to one side of a triangle and it intersects the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally. In this case, line ST is parallel to side QR of triangle PQR, and it intersects sides PQ and PR at points Q and R, respectively. Therefore, the theorem states that PQ:QR = PR:ST.\n\nWe know that $PT = PQ + QR = 6$, but we don't know the values of PQ and QR. However, we do know that $PR = PQ + QR + TR = 6 + 4 = 10$ and $ST = 8$.\n\nSo, we can set up the proportion as follows:\n\nPQ/QR = PR/ST\nPQ/QR = 10/8\nPQ/QR = 1.25\n\nSince PQ + QR = 6, we can set up the following equation:\n\nPQ + 1.25PQ = 6\n2.25PQ = 6\nPQ = 6/2.25\nPQ = 2.67 (approximately)\n\nThen, we can find QR by subtracting PQ from PT:\n\nQR = PT - PQ\nQR = 6 - 2.67\nQR = 3.33 (approximately)\n\nSo, QR is approximately 3.33.

The cosine of 180 degrees is -1, so the equation becomes:\n\nW_T = -T * d\n\nThe tension in the cable is equal to the weight of the elevator cab minus the force due to the acceleration of the cab. The weight of the cab is m * g, where m is the mass of the cab and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The force due to the acceleration of the cab is m * a, where a is the acceleration of the cab. So the tension is:\n\nT = m * g - m * a\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for the work done gives:\n\nW_T = -(m * g - m * a) * d\n\nGiven that m = 500 kg, g = 9.8 m/s^2, a = g / 5 = 9.8 / 5 = 1.96 m/s^2, and d = 12 m, we can substitute these values into the equation to find the work done:\n\nW_T = -(500 * 9.8 - 500 * 1.96) * 12\nW_T = -(4900 - 980) * 12\nW_T = -3920 * 12\nW_T = -47040 J\n\nSince work is a scalar quantity, we take the absolute value to get the final answer:\n\nW_T = 47040 J."
